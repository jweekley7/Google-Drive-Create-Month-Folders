# Google-Drive-Create-Month-Folders
Create a child folder for each month, named for that month in a parent folder

Before running, note the following:
 1. If the year to be created is not the current year, add a year parameter (as a number) to the function getThisYearFromDate() on line 9 of Main.gs
 2. Update the parentFolderId with the ID of the folder where you want the child folders to be created. The folder ID needs to remain a string (so put it between quotes)
